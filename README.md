- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, ReactJS, Redux, NextJS, React Native
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making cool websites and building websites that are easy to use
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding websites better
- 💬 Ask me about modern Javascript frameworks, best practices in front-end development, or anything related to web development
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.facebook.com/minhtoan.duong.1/
- 😄 Pronouns: Tony or Dom(Dominic)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning new things about coding, and once I stayed up all night building a website game (Flappy Bird clone)! It was hard, but I learned a lot about solving problems & self-research
