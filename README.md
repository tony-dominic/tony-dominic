### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making websites look nicer and have interesting moving pictures to make them more enjoyable to use
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, ReactJS, Redux, NextJS, React Native
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making cool websites and building websites that are easy to use
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding websites better
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about modern Javascript frameworks, best practices in front-end development, or anything related to web development

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning new things about coding, and once I stayed up all night building a website game (Flappy Bird clone)! It was hard, but I learned a lot about solving problems & self-research
